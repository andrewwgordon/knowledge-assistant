The AHRS is a crucial component that provides information about the aircraft’s attitude and heading. If it is aligning, it means that the system is calibrating itself to provide accurate readings. During this time, it is important for pilots to keep the aircraft wings level, and the standby attitude indicator should be used for reference.

The table consists of two columns:
- **Column 1**: Describes the action or condition, which in this context is maintaining wings level during AHRS alignment.
- **Column 2**: Provides additional details or notes regarding the condition, explaining that the AHRS is in the aligning phase.

Because the table content was given as key-value pairs with each condition not having an accompanying note content in the second column (thus, an empty set of parentheses), it suggests no additional instructions or notes accompany the alignment condition beyond the provided instruction.

### Comprehensive Description of the Table

The table provides performance data for a DA 42 NG aircraft during take-off under normal procedures with a specified weight of 1900 kg (4189 lb) and flaps in the UP position. The aircraft's take-off speed is 80 KIAS for rotation and 85 KIAS at 50 feet above ground level. The conditions assume maximum power settings and a dry, paved, and level runway.

The table is arranged to display the take-off distance under varying pressure altitudes and outside air temperatures, reported both in metric and imperial units. Each row represents a different pressure altitude, starting at sea level (SL) and increasing in increments up to 10,000 feet (3048 meters). Two key measurements are provided for each pressure altitude: the ground roll (the distance required to become airborne), and the total distance required to reach 15 m (50 ft) above the runway, both in meters.

The temperature columns indicate various outside air temperatures in degrees Celsius and Fahrenheit, ranging from 0°C (32°F) to 50°C (122°F). An additional column labeled "ISA" (International Standard Atmosphere) provides baseline performance figures. The note at the end reminds users of the conversion factor to change distances from meters to feet.

### Table Column Names

This markdown format will render an organized table providing clear insights into how pressure altitude and air temperatures affect the take-off distances of the aircraft.
1. **Description of the Table:**

   The table presents data on the take-off distance performance for the Diamond DA 42 NG aircraft under short field procedure conditions with a weight of 1700 kg (3748 lb) and flaps set to the approach setting (APP). The data assumes a maximum power setting and take-off on a dry, paved, and level runway. The table displays the ground roll distance and the total distance required to clear a 15-meter (50-foot) obstacle at various pressure altitudes and outside air temperatures.

   The columns are organized as follows:
   - Pressure Altitude in feet and meters
   - Take-off Performance: Ground Roll distance and 15 m (50 ft) Clearance distance
   - Outside Air Temperature ranging across six values: 0°C / 32°F, 10°C / 50°F, 20°C / 68°F, 30°C / 86°F, 40°C / 104°F, and 50°C / 122°F. An additional column is provided for ISA (International Standard Atmosphere) conditions.

   Each row corresponds to a specific pressure altitude, with the take-off performance values given for each temperature setting.

The table titled "DA 42 NG AFM Performance" provides data on the rate of climb for a DA 42 NG aircraft under specific conditions. It focuses on the performance when all engines are operating, with flaps up, and the landing gear retracted at a power setting of 92%. The table is organized to show the rate of climb expressed in feet per minute across different outside air temperatures and pressure altitudes. The climb rates are specified for a range of altitudes and temperatures, allowing for an assessment of aircraft performance under varying conditions.

### Table Column Names
1. Altitude [ft]
2. Altitude [m]
3. Outside Air Temperature [°C] (-20, -10, 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
4. Rate of Climb - ISA [ft/min]

The `[ft]` column lists altitudes in feet, while the `[m]` column provides the corresponding altitudes in meters. For each combination of altitude and outside air temperature, a value is given representing the rate of climb in feet per minute. Additionally, a column "ISA" gives the rate of climb under International Standard Atmosphere conditions, which can be used as a baseline.

```

This representation captures the rate of climb for the DA 42 NG aircraft at varying altitudes and temperature conditions with a focus on climb performance under designated settings of power and configuration.
### Description of the Table

The table provides performance data for a DA 42 NG aircraft with one engine inoperative during a climb. The flight condition parameters specified are with flaps set to "UP", the operational engine at 92% power with the other engine feathered, and the gear retracted at a climb speed of 85 KIAS. The table shows the rate of climb in feet per minute as a function of two primary variables: altitude and outside air temperature.

- **Altitudes** are listed in two units: feet (ft) and meters (m).
- **Outside Air Temperature (OAT)** is given in both degrees Celsius (°C) and degrees Fahrenheit (°F).
- For each combination of altitude and temperature, the rate of climb performance is provided.

The table is divided into two sections, each identified by a weight condition (7044/9991 and 9814/0091). These likely represent different weight configurations or settings, possibly related to the aircraft's weight limits or load conditions.

The columns represent the outside air temperature ranging from -20°C to 50°C (or -4°F to 122°F), with an additional column for ISA (International Standard Atmosphere) conditions. The rows are organized by altitude levels from Sea Level (SL) up to 18,000 feet.

**Note:** The rates of climb are negative for certain conditions, indicating a decrease in altitude rather than a climb, which reflects the performance limitations under specific high altitude and temperature conditions.
### Description of the Table

The provided table gives information on the climb performance characteristics for the DA 42 NG aircraft when operating with one engine inoperative. Key parameters are specified such as flaps up, one engine feathered at 92% power, a speed of 85 KIAS, and the landing gear retracted. The table displays the aircraft's rate of climb in feet per minute (ft/min) for various pressure altitudes and outside air temperatures.

The table is structured as follows:

- **Altitude (ft/m)**: This column shows the pressure altitude in both feet and meters.
  
- **Outside Air Temperature (°C/°F)**: This heading spans several columns that provide the temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit. The temperatures range from -20°C (-4°F) to 50°C (122°F) including the ISA (International Standard Atmosphere) deviation.
  
- **Rate of Climb (ft/min)**: Shown for different combinations of altitude and temperature, this measures the vertical speed of the aircraft. It is important to note that dark grey shaded areas in the table indicate a climb rate of less than 50 ft/min.

### Description of the Table

The table presents the landing performance data for the DA 42 NG aircraft under specific conditions. It provides information on landing distances with full landing flaps deployed (LDG) at a maximum aircraft weight of 1900 kg (4189 lbs). The data is organized according to various pressure altitudes and outside air temperatures. The landing data is split into two categories: "Ground Roll" and "15 m / 50 ft" distances, which describe the required runway length needed to bring the aircraft to a stop from an approach speed of 84 KIAS with the engines at idle.

The table is arranged with the following details:
- **Pressure Altitude (ft/m):** It denotes the altitude above the standard atmosphere level with conversion to meters.
- **Distance Type:** It indicates the kind of distance being measured, either the "Ground Roll" distance or the distance needed to pass a 15-meter (50 ft) obstacle.
- **Outside Air Temperature (°C/°F):** Lists a range of temperatures from 0°C to 50°C (32°F to 122°F) detailing how temperature affects the landing distance.
- **Distance (m):** These columns provide the required landing distance in meters under specified air temperatures and pressure altitudes.

### Description of the Table

The table presents data on the landing distance required for a DA 42 NG aircraft under an abnormal flap position, at a weight of 1999 kg (4407 lb). The conditions consider different outside air temperatures and pressure altitudes. The following specifics apply to these calculations:

- **Weight**: 1999 kg (4407 lb)
- **Flap Position**: Approach (APP) or Up (UP)
- **Velocity**: 92 Knots Indicated Air Speed (KIAS)
- **Power**: Idle
- **Runway**: Dry, paved, and level

The table includes the calculations for:
- **Pressure Altitude**, given in feet (ft) and meters (m)
- **Ground Roll**: The runway distance required to touch down and come to a complete stop
- **Landing distance over a 15 m (50 ft) obstacle**, which refers to the total runway distance needed to clear a 15-meter obstacle and comes to a stop.

The columns represent different outside air temperatures, given in degrees Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F), including an International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) value for comparison. Numerical values represent the distance in meters unless specified otherwise, and distances in feet can be calculated by multiplying by 3.28 or dividing by 0.3048.

### Description of the Table:

The table presents data related to the landing distance of a DA 42 NG aircraft, specifically under conditions of abnormal flap positions at a loaded aircraft weight of 1700 kg or 3748 lb with landing flaps either in the approach (APP) or up (UP) position. The approach speed (v_REF) is 86 KIAS with the engine power set to idle. The landing distances are calculated for various pressure altitudes and outside air temperatures on a dry, paved, and level runway.

The table is organized to show landing ground roll distances and distances to clear a 15-meter (50-foot) obstacle for different pressure altitudes, given in feet/meters. The columns represent different outside air temperatures expressed in Celsius and Fahrenheit, ranging from 0°C/32°F to 50°C/122°F, along with a standard IS value (International Standard Atmosphere).

### Table Columns:
1. **Press. Alt. [ft/m]**: Pressure altitude in feet and meters.
